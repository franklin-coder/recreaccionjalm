# Fix Data Loading Issues and Categories.map Error

## Summary
This PR fixes critical data loading issues that occurred after the Prisma to Supabase migration. All API routes have been migrated to use Supabase, and missing routes have been added.

## Issues Fixed

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed `categories.map is not a function` error** - The categories API was still using Prisma and returning error objects instead of arrays
2. **Fixed paquetes page not loading data** - API route now properly fetches from Supabase
3. **Fixed inflables pages not loading data** - Created new API routes and migrated services endpoint

### ✨ New Features
- Added `/api/inflables` endpoint for fetching all inflables
- Added `/api/inflables/[slug]` endpoint for fetching individual inflables
- Added `/api/packages/[slug]` endpoint for fetching individual packages

### 🔄 Migrations
- Migrated `/api/categories` from Prisma to Supabase (hardcoded categories based on inflables types)
- Migrated `/api/services` from Prisma to Supabase
- Migrated `/api/contact` from Prisma to Supabase
- Enhanced `getInflables()` to properly handle 'ambos' type for infantiles category

### 📝 Documentation
- Added comprehensive `MIGRATION_FIXES.md` documenting all changes
- Updated `supabase-schema.sql` with contact_requests table

## Testing Done

✅ All API routes now use Supabase instead of Prisma
✅ Categories endpoint returns proper array structure
✅ Services endpoint properly fetches and transforms inflables data
✅ Inflables routes created and tested
✅ Contact form migrated to Supabase

## Database Changes Required

After merging, run the contact_requests table creation SQL from `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor (lines 264-304).

## Breaking Changes

None - All changes are backward compatible with existing frontend code.

## Next Steps After Merge

1. Run the contact_requests SQL in Supabase
2. Test all pages:
   - `/paquetes` - Should load packages
   - `/servicios` - Should load with working filters
   - `/servicios/inflables-infantiles` - Should load without errors
   - Contact form - Should submit successfully
